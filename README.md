__ERB__ rendering can be a like driving over a rocky road. This library aims to solve this problem by offering an easy interface to render ERB from a string, from a file or towards a file. _Get off the road and onto the kerb_!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kerb'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install kerb
```

## Usage

### Render a string

```ruby
erb = 'my <%= @foo %> <%= @bar %>'
vars = {
  foo: 'lovely',
  bar: 'garden'
}

Kerb.render(erb, vars) #=> "my lovely garden"
```

### Render to a file

```ruby
erb = 'my <%= @foo %> <%= @bar %>'
vars = {
  foo: 'lovely',
  bar: 'garden'
}
file = 'path_to_file'

Kerb.render_to_file(erb, vars, file)

File.read(file) #=> "my lovely garden"
```
